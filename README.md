# Alcohol Consumption & Life Expectancy Regression Analysis (R)

Welcome to the Alcohol-Life Expectancy Regression Analysis project! This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of how alcohol consumption correlates with life expectancy across countries and years, utilizing powerful data science and machine learning techniques in R.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The project investigates the relationship between alcohol consumption and life expectancy using global health data. It applies both **linear** and **non-linear regression models** to uncover insights and trends, and includes detailed visualizations and code for reproducibility.

### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handles missing values and selects relevant features for model building.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Summarizes and visualizes distributions and relationships in the data.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Computes correlation coefficients both manually and using R's built-in functions.
- **Regression Modeling:**
  - **Simple Linear Regression:** Examines the direct relationship between alcohol and life expectancy.
  - **Non-Linear Regression:** Models more complex patterns using polynomial regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Calculates R-squared, RMSE, and other metrics to assess model performance.
- **Interactive & Publication-Ready Plots:** Uses `ggplot2` and `GGally` for beautiful, informative graphics.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaX0820/Alcohol-Life-Expectancy-Regression-Analysis-R.git
cd Alcohol-Life-Expectancy-Regression-Analysis-R
```

### 2. Install R Dependencies

Open R or RStudio and ensure these packages are installed:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyverse", "dplyr", "GGally", "caTools", "MLmetrics", "caret"))
# Optional for interactive plots:
# install.packages("plotly")
```

### 3. Run the Analysis

- Open `Project_Code.R` in RStudio.
- When prompted, select `Life Expectancy Data.csv` as your dataset file.
- Execute the code step-by-step or run all for a complete analysis.
